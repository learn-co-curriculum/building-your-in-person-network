## Building an In-Person Network 

We covered the importance of leveraging your professional network as well as how to find like-minded people online. Building an online community is a helpful way to connect to opportunities and get a job. 

Where possible, you should also build your in-person network. 


## Why In-Person Networking Matters

Despite this digital age, nothing is stronger than connecting face-to-face. Here are a few reasons why in-person networking is still important:

- **Accelerates relationship building** - When you meet someone face-to-face, you’re able to learn more about that person in ten minutes than it would take over several months online.

- **Recognition** - If meeting in-person, people can put a face to your name, as well as pick up on the actions you embody. This allows them to form a personal impression of you, which is much more memorable than any email you can send.

- **Increased understanding** - When face-to-face, you can hear the tone of voice, see facial expressions, and observe body language, energy, etc. Because of this, there’s increased understanding and it’s easier to convey purpose.

- **Opportunity to meet a variety of people** - There’s this serendipitous nature at live events. You never know who you may meet. And often the best connections come from the people you least expect.

## Types of In-Person Networking

When it comes to face-to-face networking, there are lots of options. Here are some of the most common. 

- **[Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/)** - Meetup is a platform where anyone can organize an in-person get together around a certain topic. There are lots of tech meetups in cities across the world. Meetups give you the chance to connect with others, learn about new products, and listen to talks. Meetups are usually free to attend. However, some may cost money, but usually not more than $5-10.

- **Associations/organizations** - These tend to be more formal gatherings, usually closed to members only. Being a part of an association/organization often means you must apply, and pay a membership fee. Examples: ISSA  (Information Security Systems Association) and the SANS Institute.

Here is a list of [Cybersecurity Associations](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/leading-information-security-organizations-2071545)
 
- **Conferences** - Conferences are typically several days in length, and held at convention halls or large hotels. Because of this, they are often at a higher price point. Many people will travel to attend conferences. 

Here is a regularly updated [List of Cybersecurity Conferences](https://infosec-conferences.com).

- **Other Industry (or even Non-Tech) Events** - [Gary’s Guide](https://www.garysguide.com/events) (New York City and San Francisco areas) and [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) (global) are two other places to find networking opportunities.

- **Hackathons** - Hackathons are competitions in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative projects. Participants are asked to ‘build something from nothing.’ Recruiters often attend these events, too.

- **Coworking spaces** - Coworking spaces are places people without an office go to work. Many of these people work for larger companies remotely, freelance, work at startups, or even have their own business. Coworking itself is a great way to meet people. However, many coworking spaces also host their own events. Example: [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/)

- **Volunteering** - Volunteering is an underrated networking method. Unlike happy hours and networking events, volunteering centers on giving back to a cause. However, it also provides the chance to meet new people who share your interests and do impactful work. Meeting people at volunteer events shows the people present that you’re passionate about your chosen career and that you work hard. 

- [Secure Diversity](https://securediversity.org)has information,resources and opportunities for volunteering.
- Collaborate with a team (at work or in school) on a cyber security project.
- Volunteer to do IT security work for a non-profit or charity.
- Here are some potential sources of Internships:
     - [F6S](www.f6s.com) 
     - [AngelList](www.angel.co)
     - [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com)
     - [Startupers](www.startupers.com)
     - [Work at a Startup](www.workatastartup.com)
     
While building a professional community is important, don’t limit yourself to attending only events in your industry. If you attend events outside of the industry, you’ll stand out more *because you’ll probably be one of the few there with your skill set!*

All companies and industries need talent like yours. Still, make sure to attend events you have an interest in. This way you’ll be able to make genuine connections with people who are also attending, and learn something in the process.

## Meetups: Approach - What to DO and How to Follow Up

**How to Choose Which Meetups to Attend**

When deciding on which meetups to attend, here are some things to consider:

- *Topic:* Explore both meetups both within and outside of your field of study.  A great connection can come from anywhere, tech or elsewhere! This process is about meeting people, making friends and cultivating relationships. Doing this with people who share your passions and interests will help it feel more natural and enjoyable.

- *Type:* Meetups are all designed differently. Some are for networking and socializing, while others focus on lectures, workshops, problem-solving, panel discussions or presentations. Choose a type that resonates with you.

- *Size:* Meetups come in all sizes. There are people who love the idea of a large crowd, while others feel more at ease in a smaller group. Choose one that seems most comfortable to you.

**What to Do When You’re at a Meetup**

You’ve decided on a meetup to attend. Now what?

- Set some goals and prepare:
  * How many people will you aim to meet?
  * Who specifically will you try to meet? 
     - If the attendee list is available, browse through it ahead of time and see if there are any people in particular with        whom you’d like to connect at the event itself. (Did they also graduate from a bootcamp, do they work for a company you’d      love to work for, etc.?)
     
     - Another idea is to reach out to presenters and other people who are listed as attendees in advance. You can express          enthusiasm for what they are presenting about or for what they do for work - this is a nice way to break the ice before        meeting in person, which can make it easier to initiate the in-person encounter.
     
     - You can also follow presenters on Twitter and comment there or reply to tweets about the event.
     
   * How long will you stay if you’re feeling uncomfortable and not enjoying yourself?
     - What positive "self-talk" can you pull out of your proverbial pocket if you are feeling uncomfortable? Have some            positive statements ready that you can use to bolster yourself if you are feeling out of your comfort zone.

  * Practice your elevator pitch. There’s an excellent chance someone will ask you “tell me about yourself.”

  * Prepare some open-ended questions. This type of question can’t be answered with a one word answer. These questions show interest, require thought, and can make the conversation flow a lot more easily.  Examples:
    - What are you most excited about in your field/work/studies?
    
    - What was the most inspiring meetup you've attended and why?
    
    - What made you decide to pursue a career in this field?
    
    - What are you curious about these days?
    
    - What products, startups or companies do you think are especially interesting right now?
    
    - What do you wish you could build that doesn't exist yet?

  * The opposite of an open-ended question is a closed-ended question. These types of questions can usually be answered with just one word. They’re the type you want to avoid when first starting a conversation with someone. Below, you’ll see an example of a closed-ended question and an open-ended question:
    - “Have you come to this meetup before?” The answer is either “yes” or “no.” The conversation essentially stops there and     doesn’t have anywhere to go. Don’t ask this type of question.

    - “What brings you to this meetup?” There are a number of possibilities in answering this question, which will help you       engage and build rapport with the person you’re speaking to. Do ask this type of question.

Now that you’ve done your preparation, what do you do once you’re at the event?

  * Put your phone away. This is about connecting with people face-to-face.

  * Arrive no later than the start time, and even consider arriving early. This will allow you to meet and talk with the host before everyone has arrived – and just like that, there’s one new person you’ve met.

  * How to Enter or Start a Conversation

    - Introduce yourself to people (if needed, take a deep breath before doing this). When introducing yourself, remember to       look the person in the eye.

    - Smile. Make it easy for people to talk to you. A friendly approach can overcome their self-consciousness or                 indifference. It really helps to make people want to interact with you.

    - In a reception-style or business mingling event, nothing says “Don’t come talk to me” like taking a seat. Stay on your       feet. Walk around the room and show your interest in connecting with others, even if it feels awkward or intimidating in       the moment. Everyone has been there - even the most seasoned professionals.

    - If people have already formed groups, look and sound like they are having a good time or are talking about something         that is of interest to you, stand near them and, when acknowledged, step in and respond and/or introduce yourself.

    - *Networking bonus: When you see someone trying to join your conversation or group, step back and give them a chance to       join in. In doing so, you are including the excluded and that is both gracious and memorable.*

  * Once you’ve introduced yourself, continue the conversation by asking open-ended questions (remember the information above!). Keep in mind that everyone has been new to something before. Sometimes just saying, "My name is x and I'm totally out of my comfort zone here. Nice to meet you! How did you hear about this event?", can normalize any nervousness and turn it into fuel for an honest and humorous conversation. Additional question examples:

    - What advice do you have for someone who wants to get into this field?

    - Are there any books, media sources, blogs, Twitter feeds, and the like you would recommend to someone who wants to stay     in the loop in this industry/field?

  * Ask people for their email addresses and/or business cards. You’ll need this information to use in following-up (and ideally, continuing the conversation) with them. Most people will be open to giving you the information.  However, if you find a person is unwilling to do so, let it go. There will be others who are open to it. Another strategy is to pull out your phone and add them on LinkedIn right then and there.

  * How to exit a conversation. You don’t want to spend all of your time speaking with the same people. Sometimes it is more difficult to gracefully leave a conversation than to join a conversation. Here are some tips:
   
    -  After an interesting conversation, say something like, “I don’t want to monopolize your time” or “I know there are other people who would like to talk to you.” Then indicate that the conversation was pleasant, interesting, and informative and offer a phrase or sentence that summarizes the conversation (e.g., “It was so great to get your perspective on X”).
  
   - Ask for a card or contact information, if appropriate. You might say, “I’d love to follow up on this with you. Do you have a business card?”

   - If a conversation seems to be going on way too long, you should still be polite. Wait for a natural break in the conversation and gently excuse yourself. Offer your hand for a handshake and say in a friendly voice, “I hope you enjoy the rest of the [event]” or “It was really great to meet you, I would love to follow-up!”

   - Another way to exit a conversation is to introduce your new networking contact to other people you already know. An introduction spoken with interest and enthusiasm for the person shows that you respect them and are interested in helping them pursue their own networking goals.

  * If you feel, at the end of the meetup, that you’ve really gotten something out of it – learning something new and meeting others – and you’d like to attend again, consider volunteering and helping with the next event the host puts on. Doing this would expose you to even more people, which, in turn, will expand your network. 

  * Most importantly, when you’re at the event, remember to be your authentic and genuine self!

While some people find it easy to enter a room full of strangers, others may not. If you’re more on the shy side and the idea of meeting new people makes you feel uncomfortable, try not to let that get in your way. Instead, take it one step at a time. Here are some suggestions for doing just that:

  * Start with a positive attitude and a sense of curiosity. 

    - What kinds of people might you meet if you go? What kinds of questions might you find answers to? What might you learn? 

  * Attend your first meetup, or your first few meetups, as an observer and with no expectations. 
    
    - Watch how the event runs, see how other people are networking, listen to the conversations around you, learn something new.

  * When you begin to feel more comfortable about attending, set some goals for yourself:
    - Introduce yourself to one new person (then build up to two, then three new people).
  
    - Set a time limit for how long you’ll stay if you feel uneasy and don’t find it very interesting.

    - Combine these goals and decide to stay at least for an hour or until you meet three people, whichever comes first.

  * Ask a friend to join you, but don’t stay attached to them the whole time. Perhaps make it a planned challenge to go together but aim to meet X new people each, separately, and report back (or even introduce each other to the most interesting people each person met).

  * If the first meetup you attend isn’t right for you, try another one - it’s important not to give up and to keep attending. You’ll find one that’s a good fit, and you never know who you might meet!

**How to Follow Up with New Contacts from Networking Events**

While meeting a new person at a meetup is important, it’s only the start. The next step is to build and nurture the relationship. Here are some suggestions for following up:

  * Follow up with the person you met by sending an email within 24 hours of meeting them. It’s important you reach out to them quickly, so that they remember you.

    - Reference something in your email that is specific to the conversation the two of you had. It will still be fresh in their memory and will both help them remember who you are and show that you are reflecting on the conversation with interest.

    - Let them know that you’d like to continue the conversation. Ask if they’d like to meet for a coffee (offer to buy them a cup!). Or, as an alternate option, speaking over the phone or on a video call.

> Subject: Great meeting you! More music (and coffee)?	

> Dear Jill,

> It was great meeting you last night at the [Even Name] meetup. It was fantastic to meet a fellow bootcamp grad and music lover, and chat about our final projects- both related to music industry security!

> We started talking aboutcybersecurity meetups and startups in NYC, but due to the time weren’t able to continue the conversation; I’d love to do so over coffee, my treat! Would you have some time in the evenings next week? 

> Thanks again for the conversation, and have a great night! I look forward to your reply.

> Best,

> Siobhan McCally
> Siobhanmccally.com


  * Connect with the person on LinkedIn, but make sure you personalize the note to connect and include where you met and what you talked about. NOTE: LinkedIn Connection Requests have a 300-character limit, so keep your message concise but specific about who you are and why you are looking to connection.

   	[LinkedIn Connection Request]

> Dear Jill, 

> It was great meeting you at the [Event Name] Meetup last night and chatting about our bootcamp experiences and home lab projects! I’d love to stay connected here and hope to continue the conversation (I sent a direct email as well).

> Have a wonderful day!

> Best, 
> Siobhan McCally


  * After you’ve met with the person, continue to nurture the relationship and stay in touch. Examples of how to do this are:

    - Sending them an article they might find interesting (based on what you’ve learned about them).
 
 - Congratulating them on something exciting happening to them or at their company. Set up a Google alert to let you know when the person and/or the company they work for is in the news. 

    - Inviting them to attend another upcoming meetup or event with you.

    - Giving them updates on where you are in the job search and thanking them again for the impact they had on your efforts or progress.

  * Just because you didn’t actually speak with someone at a meetup doesn’t mean you can’t add them to your network. If you hoped to meet someone but weren’t able to, or if you realized when you were there that there were people you would have liked to have met, you can try to get their contact information from the meetup organizers, or use your detective skills! Then reach out and let them know that you attended the same meetup but didn’t have the opportunity to connect with them there and ask it they would like to meet or speak to you about your common interests.


**Starting Your Own Meetup Group**

Once you get the hang of participating in meetups, you may ultimately want to found your own group! By doing so, you’ll have a unique opportunity to facilitate conversations and events about the tech topics that you personally think are important and interesting. Having a group can embolden you to reach out to established industry leaders and professionals, creating some valuable contacts and relationships for yourself.  You’ll also become known as a “Super-Connector” who is engaged and in-the-know with the local tech community at large.

## Three Key Things to Keep in Mind When Meeting New People

There are entire books dedicated to the art of networking, such as [Meet 100 People](https://meet100people.com/). They include rules to follow, body language signals to be aware of, ways to break the ice, and a whole lot more. Yet, when it comes down to it, there are two main things you need to keep in mind when you’re meeting new people face-to-face.


**1. Always Provide Value**

Value is something that keeps appearing throughout these lessons. That’s because it’s so important—whether you’re reaching out online for the first time, asking for an introduction, or meeting in-person. People network because they want to meet new people, and ultimately get something from that person. (A referral, a new job, a book deal—whatever.)

When you’re at an event, it doesn’t matter how many hands you shake, or business cards you give out. What is important is providing value by helping others. Giving first is the start of many great relationships. When you’re the first person to provide value, it gives you leverage. Leverage that you can use later.

When you’re networking and providing value for others, remember that the more important/influential the person is, the more giving you must do upfront.

You need to give value over time, until eventually you’re at a point where you can ask for something in return and it won’t come off as a nuisance. Rather, you just provided this person with so much value that they don’t even think twice about returning the favor.


**2. Listen**

The best way to figure out the value you can provide to another person is by listening to them. In order to make an authentic connection to a person you must pay attention to what that person is saying, and not thinking about what you’re going to say next.

**3. Be patient**

Part of building a strong in-person network involves patience. Don’t rush into asking new connections for favors. Instead, build up your relationship over time.

Recognize that not everyone you meet is going to be able to give you what you want right away. Some of the connections you establish may not seem to be helpful, but they might offer you value when you least expect it a year or two from now, and that’s okay.

Think of it like building long-term friendships. *You don’t ask someone you just befriended to drive you to the airport, or help you move, do you?* Exactly. You ask your closest, and longtime, friends.

## Conclusion 
The best way to build a community is by getting out and going to events in your area. While this may be easier in large cities, if you work a little harder (or drive a little further), you’ll very likely find events regardless of where you live.

When you’re at events, don’t think about what you can get out of the experience. Instead, think about what you can give to others. This kind of mindset will make you more likable, and set a strong foundation for your relationships down the line.
